 * 1298. Maximum Candies You Can Get from Boxes
 * You have n boxes labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given four arrays: status, candies, keys, and containedBoxes where:
 * status[i] is 1 if the ith box is open and 0 if the ith box is closed,
 * candies[i] is the number of candies in the ith box,
 * keys[i] is a list of the labels of the boxes you can open after opening the ith box.
 * containedBoxes[i] is a list of the boxes you found inside the ith box.
 * You are given an integer array initialBoxes that contains the labels of the boxes you initially have. You can take all the
 * candies in any open box and you can use the keys in it to open new boxes and you also can use the boxes you find in it.
 * Return the maximum number of candies you can get following the rules above.
