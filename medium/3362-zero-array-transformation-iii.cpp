 * 3362. Zero Array Transformation III
 * Medium
 * Topics
 * Companies
 * Hint
 * You are given an integer array nums of length n and a 2D array queries where queries[i] = [li, ri].
 * Each queries[i] represents the following action on nums
 * Decrement the value at each index in the range [li, ri] in nums by at most 1
 * The amount by which the value is decremented can be chosen independently for each index
 * A Zero Array is an array with all its elements equal to 0
 * Return the maximum number of elements that can be removed from queries, such that nums can still be converted to a zero 
 * array using the remaining queries. If it is not possible to convert nums to a zero array, return -1.

int maxRemoval(std::vector<int>& nums, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& queries) {
  
  return -1;
